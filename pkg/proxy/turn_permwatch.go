// pion never returns an error when a TURN allocation stops working underneath a
// live socket. A failed ChannelBind refresh, allocation refresh or permission
// refresh is only *logged* (internal/client/udp_conn.go:493,
// internal/client/allocation.go:157,168): the relay conn stays open, every
// WriteTo keeps returning success, and the relay silently stops forwarding.
// Until now the only thing that noticed was the 90s no-RX detector in
// runKeepalive — and only when the path went completely silent, which it does
// not have to: the stream keeps getting whatever the server round-robins at it
// through *other* code paths right up until it doesn't.
//
// permWatch turns those log lines into an explicit signal. pion/turn v5.0.12
// re-checks every channel binding on a 30s timer (defaultBindingCheckInterval,
// udp_conn.go:24) and re-binds one older than 5 minutes, so a server-side
// allocation that has been reaped emits "Failed to bind channel" every 30s.
// Two in a row is a confirmed blackhole in ~60s, measured on the TURN control
// plane and therefore independent of whether any WireGuard traffic is flowing.
//
// The markers are matched against pion's *literal* format strings, so a version
// bump that reworks the wording silently degrades this to "never fires" rather
// than misfiring — permwatch_test.go pins the markers against the vendored
// module so that degradation is caught at test time instead of in the field.
