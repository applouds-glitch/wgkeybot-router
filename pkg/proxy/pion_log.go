// pion never returns an error for a failed allocation Refresh, CreatePermission
// or ChannelBind — it only logs one (internal/client/allocation.go:157,168,
// internal/client/udp_conn.go:493). Those are the failures that silently kill a
// relay: the writes keep succeeding while the relay stops forwarding, so the
// stream looks alive right up until the dead-stream detector tears it down 90s
// later with no clue as to why. pion's default factory writes to stderr, which
// never reaches the app's own log file (see logging.go), so without this factory
// the diagnosis is unavailable — and with permWatch attached these lines are not
// just diagnosis but the signal the stream is recycled on (see turn_permwatch.go).
//
// pionLogFactory routes pion's own logs into turnLog with the stream ID
// attached. Only Warn and above are forwarded: pion Tracef's on the per-packet
// path (client.go:789 formats the peer address for every inbound packet), so
// the lower levels stay no-ops that never format their arguments.
// Debug was forwarded too for one diagnostic build, to answer what lifetime VK
// grants an allocation (600s, refreshed by pion at half that) and whether it
// answers a stale nonce with 438 (which pion retries) or something else (which
// it would not). Both settled, so Debug stays unlogged: on 18 streams it was
// ~10 formatted lines every two minutes carrying nothing actionable. It is
// still *inspected*, because pion reports a successful channel bind and a
// successful allocation refresh at Debug level and permWatch needs those to
// clear its failure counters — see the note calls below.
//
// watch is optional; a nil watcher turns every note into a no-op, which is what
// callers that only want logging get.
